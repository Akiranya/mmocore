#'linked'->You must only precise nodes coordinates. 2 adjacent nodes will be affiliated. The root is at coordinates 0,0.
#'automatic'-> You must only precise the children(there can more than 1) of each node. Each node can only have one parent and the root has none.
#              The display coordinates will be automatically calculated to have a good render.
#'custom'-> You must precise coordinates and children for each node, each node can have multiple parents and children.
#           The coordinates are only used for display on the GUI but will not have any impact on the affiliation between nodes.
